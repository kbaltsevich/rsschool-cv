* I like front-end because it gives me the power to transform a beautiful design into an interactive page. I like coding. I want to become a front-end web developer because it allows me to be creative, analytical and build things that help other people find and consume information. This is a rapidly developing field so every day I read something new, every day I learn something new and I like it.
* #### My skills:  
  HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Git
